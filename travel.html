            <p>Monteverde, Costa Rica is situated 4,662 feet above sea level. Monteverde’s famed cloud forests are
                the byproduct of fog (a thick, low-hanging cloud) tangling amongst the leaves and branches of the
                forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the diverse variety of animals
                and plants living in the forest. One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa Elena, which is not only home to
                a variety of restaurants with delicious food, but a serpentarium as well. You can enjoy hiking,
                ziplining, and observing the native wildlife while staying in Monteverde. It’s a truly beautiful
                place.</p>
