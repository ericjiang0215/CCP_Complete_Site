                <div class="info-item"><span>Bio:</span><span>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them. At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</span></div>

                <div class="info-item"><span>Bio:</span><span>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the
                    Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                    personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to
                    keep watch of his house. Do not let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                    mailman and squirrels every single day.</span></div>

Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal some extra treats. Sometimes Maple has boundless energy. At night, she gets the zoomies after eating her final meal of the day. It usually takes her another hour to settle down before she can take a long nap.</span></div>

Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed. 
                    Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi' to you after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</span></div>
